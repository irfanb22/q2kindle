# q2kindle — Project Reference

Read this file first before working on this project. It covers how the app works, how it was built, key decisions, and known issues.

## What this is

A web app that lets you paste article URLs, queue them up, and send them to your Kindle as a formatted EPUB ebook via email — similar to Instapaper's send-to-Kindle feature. You paste a link, the app extracts the article content, and when you're ready (or automatically on a schedule), it bundles everything into an EPUB and emails it to your Kindle address.

**This project is being rewritten** from a Python desktop app (v1) to a full-stack TypeScript web app (v2). Both versions live in this repo. See "V2 Web App Rewrite" below for the current plan and progress.

## Project location

`~/Projects/kindle-sender` on the developer's Mac. The repo has a GitHub remote at `github.com/irfanb22/q2kindle`.

# V1 — Python Desktop App (Legacy)

The original app. Still functional but being replaced by the v2 web app. All v1 files live in the repo root.

## V1 Tech stack

- **Backend**: Python 3 / Flask (web server + API routes)
- **Frontend**: Single HTML file with vanilla JS (no frameworks)
- **Article extraction**: trafilatura 2.0
- **EPUB creation**: ebooklib 0.18
- **Email delivery**: Python's built-in smtplib (SMTP via Gmail app passwords)
- **Desktop window**: pywebview 5.3.2 (when running from terminal; disabled in .app bundles)
- **macOS packaging**: py2app (builds a standalone .app bundle)

## V1 File overview

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app.py` (~525 lines) | The entire backend: Flask routes, article extraction, EPUB creation, email sending, queue/settings persistence, background scheduler, and app entry points |
| `templates/index.html` (~655 lines) | Single-page frontend with all CSS and JS inline. Two collapsible settings panels. All event binding uses `addEventListener` (no inline `onclick` — those are blocked by pywebview's WebKit CSP) |
| `setup.py` | py2app build configuration. Lists all packages and includes needed for bundling |
| `build.sh` | One-command build script: creates venv, installs deps + py2app, cleans old builds, runs py2app, opens dist/ |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies: flask, trafilatura, ebooklib, pywebview |
| `Kindle Sender.command` | Double-clickable macOS launcher for running without py2app. Creates a venv on first run |
| `icon.icns` | App icon (dark rounded square with open book and green send arrow) |
| `settings.json` | Created at runtime. Stores email config and schedule preferences. Gitignored |
| `queue.json` | Created at runtime. Persists the article queue across launches. Gitignored |

## How the V1 app works

### Core flow

1. User pastes a URL into the input field (or drags a link onto the drop zone)
2. Backend calls `fetch_article()` which uses trafilatura to download and extract readable text, title, and author
3. The extracted article is added to the in-memory `ARTICLES` list and persisted to `queue.json`
4. When the user clicks "Send to Kindle" (or auto-send triggers), `create_epub()` builds an EPUB from all queued articles, and `send_to_kindle_email()` emails it as an attachment
5. On success, the queue is cleared

### Article extraction details

trafilatura 2.0 returns either a dict or a Document object depending on the version, so `fetch_article()` uses `isinstance()` checks with `getattr()` fallbacks to handle both. There's also a `_extract_title_from_html()` fallback that tries `og:title`, `twitter:title`, and `<title>` tags if trafilatura doesn't return a title.

### EPUB format

The EPUB is titled "ReadLater - YYYY-MM-DD" with each article as a separate chapter. Articles get a serif font (Georgia), 1.7 line height, and a metadata line showing author and source URL. The table of contents is auto-generated from chapter titles.

### Email delivery

Uses SMTP (default: Gmail on port 587 with STARTTLS). Requires:
- A Gmail "app password" (not your regular password)
- The sender email added to Amazon's approved senders list
- Your Kindle email address (found in Amazon > Manage Content & Devices > Preferences)

### Auto-send features

Two automation modes, both optional:

1. **Threshold auto-send**: When the queue reaches N articles, they're automatically bundled and sent. Checked every time an article is added.
2. **Scheduled weekly send**: Sends on a specific day/time. A background thread checks every 60 seconds. If the app wasn't open at the scheduled time, `_check_missed_send()` catches up on the next launch (looks back up to 7 days).

### Settings persistence

Settings and schedule preferences are stored in `settings.json`. The frontend uses a merge pattern when saving — it fetches the current settings, updates only the relevant fields, and POSTs the full object back. This prevents the email settings panel from clobbering the schedule settings panel and vice versa.

### Queue persistence

The article queue (including full extracted text) is stored in `queue.json` and loaded on startup. This means articles survive app restarts.

## How to run V1

### From terminal (development)

```bash
cd ~/Projects/kindle-sender
source .venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```

This tries pywebview first (native window), falls back to opening in the browser.

### Double-click launcher

Double-click `Kindle Sender.command`. On first run, it creates a `.venv` and installs dependencies automatically.

### As a macOS .app

```bash
cd ~/Projects/kindle-sender
./build.sh
```

The built app appears at `dist/Kindle Sender.app`. Drag it to Applications. The .app always runs in browser mode (pywebview is disabled in bundles).

## V1 App entry points

`app.py` has three run modes at the bottom:

- `run_desktop()` — Starts Flask on a random free port in a background thread, then opens a pywebview native window pointing at it
- `run_browser()` — Starts Flask on a random free port, opens the system browser, runs Flask in the foreground
- The `__main__` block checks `_is_bundled_app()` to decide: bundled .app always uses `run_browser()`; otherwise tries pywebview first with a fallback to browser

## V1 py2app build — issues encountered and fixes

### 1. charset_normalizer ModuleNotFoundError

**Problem**: The bundled app crashed on launch with `ModuleNotFoundError: charset_normalizer.md__mypyc`.

**Fix**: Added `charset_normalizer` to the `packages` list and `charset_normalizer.md__mypyc` to the `includes` list in `setup.py`.

### 2. pywebview Cocoa crash inside py2app bundles

**Problem**: pywebview's Cocoa/WebKit backend triggers `module 'objc._objc' has no attribute '__file__'` when running inside a py2app bundle.

**Fix**: Added `_is_bundled_app()` detection in `app.py` that checks for `sys.frozen` or `.app/Contents` in the executable path. When detected, the app skips pywebview entirely and uses browser mode. Also removed `webview` from the `setup.py` packages list.

### 3. Port 5000 conflict on macOS Monterey+

**Problem**: First launch would hang (bouncing dock icon, never opens). Second launch after force-quit would work. macOS Monterey and later uses port 5000 for AirPlay Receiver, and `run_browser()` was hardcoding port 5000.

**Fix**: Changed `run_browser()` to use the existing `_find_free_port()` function instead of hardcoded port 5000.

## V1 py2app setup.py packages

These are the packages and includes that py2app needs to bundle correctly:

- **packages**: flask, trafilatura, ebooklib, jinja2, lxml, certifi, charset_normalizer, lxml_html_clean
- **includes**: lxml.html.clean, lxml._elementpath, charset_normalizer.md__mypyc
- webview was intentionally removed from packages (causes Cocoa crash in bundles)

---

# V2 — Web App Rewrite (In Progress)

Full rewrite from Python desktop app to a hosted TypeScript web app. All v2 code lives in the `web/` subdirectory.

## Why the rewrite

- py2app packaging was painful and fragile
- Needed multi-device access (phone, tablet, any browser)
- UI felt rough/outdated — wanted a modern, polished interface
- Wanted new features (article preview/reader, send history)
- Unified language (TypeScript everywhere) instead of Python backend + JS frontend

### Phase 1 progress

- ✅ Next.js project scaffolded with TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4
- ✅ Supabase client configured (browser, server, middleware)
- ✅ Environment variables set up (`.env.local`)
- ✅ Auth callback route (`/auth/callback`)
- ✅ Middleware for route protection (login redirect, session refresh)
- ✅ Login page with magic link flow (Instrument Serif + DM Sans, dark editorial design)
- ✅ Supabase database tables (articles, send_history, settings) — with RLS policies
- ✅ Dashboard page shell — URL input, article queue list, send button, empty states
- ✅ App navigation/layout for authenticated pages — shared nav bar via `(app)` route group

### Phase 2 progress

- ✅ Server-side article extraction API (`/api/articles/extract`) using `@extractus/article-extractor`
- ✅ Extracts title, author, content, description from article URLs
- ✅ Read time calculation (238 words per minute) stored in `read_time_minutes` column
- ✅ Background extraction UX — article appears instantly with shimmer loading animation
- ✅ Richer queue cards — title, author (fallback to website name), read time with clock icon
- ✅ Failed extraction warning — amber badge when content can't be extracted
- ✅ Shared Article type definition (`web/src/lib/types.ts`)
- ✅ Database migration 002 — added `read_time_minutes` and `description` columns
- ✅ Middleware updated to exclude API routes from auth redirect

### Phase 3 progress

- ✅ Kindle preview page at `/article/[id]` with client-side data fetching
- ✅ Stylized e-reader device mockup — pure CSS frame (`#3a3a3a` bezel, 420×620px, rounded corners, chin dot)
- ✅ E-ink screen simulation — cream `#f5f1e8` background, Georgia serif typography, grayscale filter on all content
- ✅ HTML sanitization with DOMPurify — explicit allowlist for tags/attributes, blocks scripts and event handlers
- ✅ Scrollable content inside fixed device frame
- ✅ Title + author + read time displayed inside the screen (like ebook chapter start)
- ✅ Loading state with shimmer skeleton inside the Kindle frame
- ✅ Error states — "Article not found" and "Content could not be extracted" with original URL
- ✅ Preview button (eye icon) on dashboard queue cards — hidden during extraction, green hover
- ✅ Wider layout (`max-w-6xl`) for article preview route
- ✅ Back to queue navigation button

### Phase 4 progress

- ✅ EPUB generation using `epub-gen-memory` — in-memory Buffer, no filesystem needed
- ✅ ESM import fix — `epubModule.default ?? epubModule` to get the actual generator function
- ✅ EPUB format matches V1: "ReadLater - YYYY-MM-DD" title, Georgia serif, 1.7 line height, author + URL per chapter
- ✅ Email sending via Nodemailer + Gmail SMTP (app password auth)
- ✅ Kindle body fix — `html: "<div></div>"` instead of `text: ""` to avoid Amazon E009 "No Attachment" rejection
- ✅ Send API route (`/api/send`) — full pipeline: auth → load settings → fetch articles → generate EPUB → send email → update statuses → log to send_history
- ✅ Articles with failed extraction silently skipped (skipped count shown in success message)
- ✅ Separate try/catch for EPUB generation vs email sending — distinct error messages
- ✅ Settings API route (`/api/settings`) — GET with masked password, POST with upsert
- ✅ Settings page — Kindle email, Gmail address, app password inputs with help links
- ✅ Auto-send section shown as disabled "Coming soon" placeholder
- ✅ Password preservation — updating emails without re-entering password uses direct Supabase update
- ✅ Dashboard send button wired up — spinner during send, disabled while articles extracting
- ✅ Green success banner after send, auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- ✅ Redirects to `/settings` if email config not yet saved
- ✅ `next.config.ts` updated with `serverExternalPackages: ["epub-gen-memory"]`
- ✅ Settings type added to shared types (`web/src/lib/types.ts`)

### Phase 4.5 progress (Deployment)

- ✅ Netlify site created, auto-deploys from GitHub `main` branch
- ✅ `netlify.toml` configured with `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` for SSR/API routes
- ✅ Netlify env vars set (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)
- ✅ Supabase Site URL + redirect URLs updated for production domain
- ✅ Resend configured as custom SMTP in Supabase (replaces rate-limited built-in email provider)
- ✅ Magic link auth verified working on production (`https://q2kindle.com`)
- ✅ Send-to-Kindle verified working on Netlify (manual send + scheduled cron send)

### Phase 5 progress (Auto-Send, History & Settings Polish)

- ✅ Send History page — queries `send_history` table, shows last 10 sends with status icon, article count, error message, smart date formatting
- ✅ `SendHistory` type added to shared types (`web/src/lib/types.ts`)
- ✅ Unified "Automatic Delivery" system — replaces confusing "threshold OR schedule" with day-of-week checkboxes + time + timezone
- ✅ Day picker — 7 pill-style toggles (Mon–Sun), user picks any combination of days
- ✅ Timezone picker — auto-detected via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, full IANA timezone list via `Intl.supportedValuesOf('timeZone')`
- ✅ Minimum article count — gate on scheduled sends (1–50, default 1), skips delivery if queue is below minimum
- ✅ Dashboard simplified — removed threshold countdown toast, timer, and cancel button entirely
- ✅ Scheduled send via Supabase `pg_cron` + `pg_net` calling `/api/cron/send` hourly — multi-day matching (`schedule_days` array contains current day), timezone-aware via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`
- ✅ Uses Supabase service role key to bypass RLS (runs without user session)
- ✅ `netlify.toml` cleaned up (removed `[functions]` config — Netlify standalone functions don't work with Next.js plugin)
- ✅ Settings page visual polish — section header icons, card-like groupings, better spacing
- ✅ Test email button — sends a mini test EPUB to verify full pipeline (SMTP config + Kindle address)
- ✅ Test email API route (`/api/send/test`) — generates small EPUB with delivery confirmation content
- ✅ Test button disabled until email settings are saved; shows spinner during send
- ✅ Password-preserving save — updating delivery settings without re-entering password uses direct Supabase update
- ✅ DB migration 003 — `schedule_day` → `schedule_days text[]`, `auto_send_threshold` → `min_article_count`, added `timezone` column
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` env var set on Netlify
- ⚠️ Netlify Scheduled Functions do NOT work with `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` — the plugin overrides standalone functions entirely. Cron is handled by Supabase `pg_cron` instead.

### Phase 6 progress (EPUB Customization)

- ✅ **Cover page** — branded cover on every digest with "q2kindle" branding, issue number, date, article count, total read time. Uses `beforeToc: true` + `excludeFromToc: true` for proper spine ordering.
- ✅ **Issue number tracking** — auto-incremented per user on each successful send. Stored in `send_history.issue_number`. Both manual and cron send routes query previous sends for next sequential number.
- ✅ **Image toggle** — include images on/off (default: on). When off, `<img>`, `<picture>`, and `<figure>` tags stripped via `stripImages()`. Stored in `settings.epub_include_images`.
- ✅ **Metadata toggles** — three independent toggles for article headers: author (on/off), read time (on/off), published date (on/off). All default to on. Stored as individual boolean columns on `settings`.
- ✅ **EPUB Formatting section on Settings page** — image toggle, metadata toggles. Saved alongside email settings.
- ✅ **Shared EPUB generation module** — `web/src/lib/epub.ts` with `generateKindleEpub()`, `buildCss()`, `stripImages()`. Used by both `/api/send` and `/api/cron/send`.
- ✅ **DB migration 004** — `epub_include_images`, `epub_show_author`, `epub_show_read_time`, `epub_show_published_date` columns on `settings`; `issue_number` on `send_history`; `published_at` on `articles`.
- ✅ **Full pipeline integration** — both manual send and cron send routes load EPUB preferences and pass to `generateKindleEpub()`.

### Phase 6.5 progress (Custom Domain)

- ✅ Purchased `q2kindle.com` domain via Squarespace
- ✅ DNS configured: A record (`@` → `75.2.60.5`) + CNAME (`www` → `q2kindle.netlify.app`)
- ✅ Netlify custom domain added, `q2kindle.com` set as primary domain
- ✅ SSL/TLS certificate provisioned via Let's Encrypt (covers `q2kindle.com` and `www.q2kindle.com`)
- ✅ Supabase Site URL updated to `https://q2kindle.com`
- ✅ Supabase redirect URLs: `https://q2kindle.com/auth/callback`, `https://q2kindle.netlify.app/auth/callback`, `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
- ✅ Magic link auth verified working end-to-end on `q2kindle.com`

### Phase 7 progress (Polish & Branding)

- ✅ **Clickable article links** — article titles on queue cards link to original URLs (green hover + underline, opens in new tab). Uses `extractDomain()` fallback for display text.
- ✅ **Enhanced send history** — `articles_data` JSONB column on `send_history` stores article title/URL snapshots per send. History entries with data show chevron, expand on click to reveal numbered article list with linked titles. Migration 005. Both `/api/send` and `/api/cron/send` store article data on success.
- ✅ **EPUB cover page ordering** — cover chapter uses `beforeToc: true` + `excludeFromToc: true` so it appears before the auto-generated TOC in reading order.
- ✅ **Hourly delivery time picker** — replaced free-form `<input type="time">` with `<select>` of hourly slots (12 AM–11 PM), since pg_cron runs hourly. Normalizes existing minute-based values on load.
- ✅ **Custom domain** — `q2kindle.com` configured via Squarespace DNS + Netlify + Supabase auth URL updates
- ⬜ **Dynamic cover image for Kindle library** — Kindle's library grid needs an actual image file (not just an HTML chapter) registered in EPUB metadata via `<meta name="cover"/>`. `epub-gen-memory` supports a `cover` option (URL or File) that handles this. Current HTML cover page renders when reading but doesn't appear in the Kindle library view. Need to dynamically generate a cover image (using @vercel/og, sharp+canvas, or SVG-to-PNG) matching the current cover design (brand, issue number, date, article count) and pass it to `generateEpub()`. Instapaper does this — their cover shows in the library.
- ⬜ Mobile responsive design — breakpoints for phone/tablet, responsive Kindle mockup
- ⬜ Loading states and error handling improvements across all pages
- ⬜ PWA manifest, service worker, app icons
- ⬜ **Favicon / web icon** — part of branding work, designed alongside logo and app identity
- ⬜ **Branding** — finalize logo, color palette, favicon, update cover page branding to match
- ✅ **Resend custom domain** — `q2kindle.com` verified in Resend with DKIM + SPF DNS records. Supabase SMTP sender updated from `onboarding@resend.dev` to `team@q2kindle.com`. Fixes new user sign-up (shared Resend domain only sends to verified emails).
- ✅ **App-owned email for Kindle delivery** — Replaced user-provided Gmail SMTP credentials with app-owned sending. Users only provide Kindle email and add `kindle@q2kindle.com` to Amazon approved senders. Shared `email.ts` module centralizes sending logic. Initially used Amazon SES (denied production access twice), switched to Brevo SMTP (300 emails/day free, 4MB attachment limit). Resend stays for auth emails via Supabase SMTP.
- ✅ **Daily send limit (10/day per user)** — Protects SES costs and prevents abuse. Each "send" = one email (all queued articles bundled into one EPUB). Both manual and scheduled/cron sends count. Test emails do NOT count. No database migration needed — counts successful sends from `send_history` table. Shared `send-limits.ts` module with `DAILY_SEND_LIMIT` constant, timezone-aware `getDailySendCount()`. Manual send returns HTTP 429 at limit; cron skips silently. Settings page shows usage card with progress bar (green/red). Dashboard shows usage text below send button, disables button at limit.
- ✅ **Privacy policy page** — `/privacy` route with 7 content sections (dark editorial design, server component). Added to middleware public routes. Link in login page footer.
- ⬜ **Test email feedback position** — success/failure message appears at bottom of settings page, should be near the test send button so users can see the result without scrolling

## V2 Pages (planned)

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/` | Login — magic link email input |
| `/dashboard` | Main app — URL input, article queue, send button |
| `/article/:id` | Article reader/preview — read extracted content before sending |

- **Env vars on Netlify**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `BREVO_SMTP_LOGIN`, `BREVO_SMTP_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- **Supabase Site URL**: Must be set to `https://q2kindle.com` (in Auth > URL Configuration)
- **Supabase Redirect URLs**: Must include `https://q2kindle.com/auth/callback`, `https://q2kindle.netlify.app/auth/callback`, and `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
- **Supabase Custom SMTP**: Resend (configured in Supabase Dashboard > Project Settings > Auth > SMTP Settings)
  - **Host**: `smtp.resend.com`
  - **Port**: `465`
  - **Username**: `resend`
  - **Password**: Resend API key (set in Supabase dashboard, not in codebase)
  - **Sender email**: `team@q2kindle.com` (custom domain, verified in Resend)

### Deployment status

- ✅ Site created and building from GitHub `main` branch
- ✅ Netlify env vars configured
- ✅ Supabase Site URL updated to Netlify domain
- ✅ Supabase redirect URL added for Netlify domain
- ✅ **Auth login verified working** — magic link emails delivered via Resend custom SMTP. Supabase's built-in email provider was silently dropping emails due to free-tier rate limits; Resend fixed this.
- ✅ Custom domain `q2kindle.com` configured — DNS via Squarespace, SSL via Let's Encrypt, Supabase auth updated
- ✅ Magic link auth verified working end-to-end on `q2kindle.com`
- ✅ **Send-to-Kindle verified working on Netlify** — Brevo SMTP delivery confirmed working in production (test email + manual send)
- ✅ **Switched from Amazon SES to Brevo** — AWS denied SES production access twice. Brevo provides 300 emails/day free with SMTP access. Domain `q2kindle.com` verified in Brevo with DKIM. Sender: `kindle@q2kindle.com`.
- ⬜ **Run migration 006** — drop `sender_email` and `smtp_password` columns from settings table. Run in Supabase SQL Editor.

### Deployment files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `netlify.toml` | Build config — base dir, build command, Node version, Next.js plugin |
| `web/package.json` | Added `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` to devDependencies |

### Deployment gotchas

- `netlify.toml` `base` resolves relative to the git repo root, not the current working directory. In worktrees, Netlify CLI may resolve to the main repo's `web/` instead of the worktree's. Use GitHub integration (auto-deploy from push) instead of local `netlify deploy --build`.
- Netlify's `--no-build` deploy with `--dir=.next` does NOT work for Next.js apps with SSR/API routes. The `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` must run during the build to properly set up serverless functions.
- Node 22 LTS is used instead of v24 since Netlify may not support v24 yet.
- The `require()` import for epub-gen-memory (instead of ESM `import`) was needed to avoid TypeScript strict mode error on `.default` property access in the Netlify build environment.

## Decision log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-02-08 | Rewrite as full-stack TypeScript web app | py2app was fragile, needed multi-device access, wanted modern UI |
| 2025-02-08 | Chose Next.js + Tailwind + Supabase + Netlify | Developer had Netlify/Supabase accounts; Next.js has best Netlify support; Supabase gives free Postgres + auth |
| 2025-02-08 | Magic link auth (passwordless) | Simpler UX, no passwords to manage |
| 2025-02-08 | Supabase + local cache for storage | Supabase as source of truth for multi-device sync, local cache for speed |
| 2025-02-08 | Keep v1 Python code in repo root | Still functional, can reference during rewrite, no need to delete yet |
| 2025-02-08 | Node.js installed via nvm (v24 LTS) | Developer didn't have Node installed; nvm allows easy version management |
| 2025-02-10 | Background extraction UX (not inline wait) | Matches Instapaper/Reader pattern — article appears instantly, content fills in |
| 2025-02-10 | Author fallback to website name | If no author extracted, show publisher/source name, then domain as last resort |
| 2025-02-10 | Read time at 238 wpm | Industry standard reading speed; stored as integer minutes in DB |
| 2025-02-10 | Split Kindle preview into separate Phase 3 | Keep Phase 2 focused on extraction; preview is a distinct feature |
| 2025-02-10 | Failed extraction adds with warning, not rejected | User keeps the URL in queue even if content can't be extracted |
| 2025-02-10 | Generic stylized Kindle mockup (not specific model) | Avoids trademark issues; cleaner look with CSS-only frame |
| 2025-02-10 | E-ink grayscale filter on article content | CSS `filter: grayscale(1)` simulates real Kindle e-ink display |
| 2025-02-10 | DOMPurify for HTML sanitization (client-side) | Industry standard; explicit allowlist prevents XSS from extracted article HTML |
| 2025-02-10 | Dedicated Preview button (not clickable card) | Explicit action keeps delete button safe from accidental clicks |
| 2025-02-10 | Scrollable content inside fixed frame | More realistic than paginated; simpler to implement |
| 2025-02-10 | Lighter bezel (`#3a3a3a`) against dark background | Dark `#1a1a1a` bezel was invisible on `#0a0a0a` app background |
| 2025-02-12 | `epub-gen-memory` for EPUB generation | In-memory Buffer output, no filesystem writes, works in serverless |
| 2025-02-12 | Main import, not `/sabstub` subpath | `/sabstub` uses `window` which breaks in Node.js server-side |
| 2025-02-12 | `epubModule.default ?? epubModule` pattern | ESM default import returns module object, not the function |
| 2025-02-12 | Nodemailer with `html: "<div></div>"` body | Amazon Kindle rejects emails with no body (E009); Python's MIMEMultipart always includes one |
| 2025-02-12 | Keep images in EPUB | Richer content; `ignoreFailedDownloads: true` as safety net for slow servers |
| 2025-02-12 | Settings page pulled forward from Phase 5 | Needed for send flow; built full page instead of a temporary modal |
| 2025-02-12 | Skip articles with failed extraction silently | Send only articles with content; show skipped count in success message |
| 2025-02-12 | Password masked in GET, preserved on email-only updates | Never send actual password to client; direct Supabase update avoids re-entering password |
| 2025-02-14 | Deploy to Netlify now (before Phase 5) | Get it live with current features; iterate and redeploy |
| 2025-02-14 | Netlify free subdomain (not custom domain) | `q2kindle.netlify.app` is sufficient for now |
| 2025-02-14 | `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` required | Without it, Netlify serves 404 for all routes — SSR/API routes need the plugin |
| 2025-02-14 | Node 22 LTS for Netlify builds | v24 may not be supported on Netlify yet |
| 2025-02-14 | `require()` for epub-gen-memory in send route | ESM `import` caused TS strict mode error on `.default` access during Netlify build |
| 2025-02-14 | GitHub integration for deploys (not local CLI) | Worktree path resolution issues with `netlify deploy --build`; GitHub auto-deploy is more reliable |
| 2026-02-14 | Resend for Supabase auth emails (not built-in provider) | Supabase's free-tier email provider silently drops emails after ~3-4/hour with no error. Resend free tier (3k/month) configured as custom SMTP in Supabase dashboard. Uses shared `onboarding@resend.dev` domain — no custom domain needed. |
| 2026-02-14 | EPUB customization as Phase 6 (not part of Phase 5) | Phase 5 focuses on auto-send/history. EPUB formatting (cover page, fonts, images, metadata) is a distinct feature set that deserves its own phase. Bumped polish/PWA to Phase 7. |
| 2026-02-14 | Cover page always on (no toggle) | Part of product identity — every digest gets a branded cover. Reduces settings complexity. |
| 2026-02-26 | Removed EPUB font picker | Kindle ignores CSS `font-family` in EPUBs — the reader's device font setting always wins. The font dropdown was cosmetic. Removed `FONT_MAP`, `epub_font` column, and font UI. EPUB CSS now omits `font-family` entirely. |
| 2026-02-14 | JSONB column for EPUB preferences (considered) | Single `epub_preferences` JSONB column vs individual columns — more flexible for adding future options without migrations. Decision TBD at implementation time. |
| 2026-02-14 | No archive/read-tracking links in EPUB | Adds complexity (server-side redirect routes, tracking state) for marginal value. Can revisit later. |
| 2026-02-15 | Supabase pg_cron for scheduled send (replaces Netlify Scheduled Function) | `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` completely overrides standalone Netlify functions — the Next.js Server Handler intercepts all invocations, so standalone functions never execute (zero logs, zero metrics). Replaced with Supabase `pg_cron` + `pg_net` calling `/api/cron/send` every hour. Cron job created via SQL in Supabase dashboard. Requires SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY env var on Netlify. |
| 2026-02-15 | Test email sends mini EPUB (not plain text) | Tests the full pipeline: EPUB generation + SMTP + Kindle delivery. Catches more failure modes than a plain text email. |
| 2026-02-15 | Send history shows simple summary (no article titles) | DB only stores article_count; avoids join table complexity. Shows date, count, and status per entry. |
| 2026-02-16 | Unified delivery system (replaced threshold + single-day schedule) | Instapaper-inspired design. Day-of-week checkboxes instead of dropdown, minimum article count as gate instead of threshold trigger, timezone picker. Simpler, clearer UX. |
| 2026-02-16 | Day checkboxes instead of daily/weekly dropdown | User picks any combination of Mon–Sun. More flexible than "daily or pick one day". |
| 2026-02-16 | Minimum article count as gate (not threshold trigger) | Scheduled sends skip if queue < minimum. Removed countdown toast from dashboard entirely — less intrusive. |
| 2026-02-16 | Timezone picker with auto-detection | `Intl.supportedValuesOf('timeZone')` for full list, `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` for auto-detect. No external library needed. |
| 2026-02-16 | `schedule_days text[]` column (replaces `schedule_day text`) | Postgres array column stores multiple days. Scheduled function checks if current day is in the array. |
| 2026-02-18 | Clickable article titles (not separate link element) | Title is the link — clicking opens original URL in new tab. Green hover matches design system. |
| 2026-02-18 | `articles_data` JSONB on send_history (not join table) | Lightweight snapshot of `[{title, url}]` per send. No relational integrity needed — articles may be deleted later. Simpler than a join table. Older rows have `null` and gracefully show no expand chevron. |
| 2026-02-18 | Inline expandable history (not separate detail page) | Data is lightweight (just titles and URLs). Expanding in-place is more natural UX than navigating to a separate page. |
| 2026-02-18 | EPUB cover uses `beforeToc: true` | `epub-gen-memory` auto-generates a TOC page. Without `beforeToc`, cover was placed after TOC. Spine order: beforeToc chapters → TOC → regular chapters. |
| 2026-02-18 | Hourly delivery time picker (not free-form) | pg_cron runs every hour (`'0 * * * *'`), cron route matches by hour only. Free-form minute input was misleading — users could set 7:30 PM but cron only fires at 7:00 PM. Replaced with `<select>` dropdown of hourly slots. |
| 2026-02-18 | Dynamic cover image for Kindle library (TODO) | Kindle library grid shows cover image from EPUB metadata (`<meta name="cover"/>`), not from HTML chapters. `epub-gen-memory` supports `cover` option (URL or File). Need to generate image server-side matching current cover design. Deferred for later implementation. |
| 2026-02-18 | Custom domain `q2kindle.com` (Squarespace) | Bought `.com` over `.app` — cheaper ($14 vs $20), more universally recognized, HTTPS-only benefit of `.app` is moot with Netlify auto-SSL. DNS: A record + www CNAME → Netlify. Supabase auth URLs updated. |
| 2026-02-19 | Resend custom domain `q2kindle.com` (replaces shared `onboarding@resend.dev`) | Shared Resend domain only delivers to verified email addresses — blocked new user sign-ups. Custom domain with DKIM + SPF DNS records allows sending to any recipient. Sender updated to `team@q2kindle.com`. |
| 2026-02-21 | Amazon SES for Kindle delivery (replaces user-provided Gmail SMTP) | Storing user Gmail app passwords was a security risk and trust barrier. SES sends from `kindle@q2kindle.com` — users only provide Kindle email. SES scales to thousands/day at $0.10/1000 vs Resend's 100/day free cap. Nodemailer kept with SES transport for minimal code change. Resend stays for Supabase auth emails. |
| 2026-02-23 | Daily send limit (10/day per user) | Protects SES costs at scale. Reuses `send_history` table — no migration needed. Counts successful sends since midnight in user's timezone. Both manual and cron sends count; test emails don't. Fail-open pattern (returns 0 on query error, doesn't block sends). Usage displayed on settings page (progress bar) and dashboard (text + disabled button at limit). |
| 2026-02-25 | Brevo SMTP for Kindle delivery (replaces Amazon SES) | AWS denied SES production access twice — sandbox mode blocks sending to Kindle addresses (can't verify them). Brevo offers 300 emails/day free with SMTP access, no monthly fee. 4MB per-file attachment limit (text-only EPUBs are well under 1MB; image toggle available). Supports ~30 active users at 10 sends/day before needing $9/mo paid plan. Nodemailer kept with SMTP transport. Only `email.ts` changed — send routes untouched. |
| 2026-02-25 | Privacy policy page at /privacy | Added to strengthen SES reapplication (ultimately switched providers). Public page accessible without login, matches dark editorial design. Linked from login page footer. |
